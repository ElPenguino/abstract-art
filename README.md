Abstract Art
============

0.7.0 (Criminal Caterpillar)

This live wallpaper recreates the hypnotic tripped-out visuals featured in the cult favorite SNES game Earthbound. Even if you've never heard of it, these animated wallpapers stand all on their own. With the hundreds of backgrounds available in this tiny 200kB package, you almost can't afford not to download it! By leveraging the power of cutting-edge OpenGL shader technology, this app brings sweet visuals with low power consumption. Be the first person on your street with a totally sweet wallpaper that doesn't bust your battery. Makes a great conversation starter. Use it to help meet the man or woman of your dreams! :)

Instructions
------------

1.  Install and set as your live wallpaper.

2.  Double tap a blank spot on your home screen to load a different random background (behavior is configurable in the settings).

3.  Check out the background chooser (accessible via the settings) to make a custom background playlist!

Background Chooser
------------------

*  Click on a thumbnail once to preview it. Click it two or more times to check/uncheck it.

*  Every background that you check will be included in a custom wallpaper "playlist."

*  If you only want a single background to display, clear all the checks, and recheck the one you like.

*  The "Select All" and "Clear All" methods are included (press your menu button or check the action bar) for your convenience. :)

Disclaimer

This app is available for download and use, free of charge.

This is alpha software! I'm releasing very early in the development cycle because I've basically reached the limit of the testing I can do with my available resources. It might run poorly on your phone, crash randomly and for no reason, or simply not run at all. If you're not willing to deal with potentially flaky software, don't download this application! But if you decide to give it a try, please consider taking a moment to let me know how it runs, any problems you had, and what kind of device you have.
Thanks! :)

Compatibility
-------------

I don't have access to many Android devices, so it's tricky to know how well this works on various devices. I'll compile a partial list here of tested devices and known problems. For the record, my reference development device is the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket.

*  Motorola Droid X - palette color cycling doesn't work (yet)
*  Samsung Galaxy S - palette color cycling doesn't work (yet)
*  Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket
